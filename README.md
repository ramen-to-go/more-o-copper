## Story

For a long time I wanted to start to learn some Minecraft modding, but I never really started until recently. I wasn't sure what exactly I wanted to do so I started with the basics; in this case an ingot and tools. I can't guarantee that I will maintain the mod, but I will definetly use it to learn more about modding in Minecraft!

## License

The mod is under the LGPL-3.0-or-later licence.
