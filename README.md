# More O' Copper

A small mod adding a bit more uses to vanilla copper!

## Story

I found that copper kept piling up in my inventory while mining, so I thought to myself, what could I do to fix that?
Thats how I ended up creating this mod. I also use it to get started with Quilt, since I haven't done anything in regards to modding for a long time.

## License

Currently the mod is marked as "All Rights Reserved".
The mod is planned to release with an MIT License as soon as I think it is ready to get a public release. (Currently the mod is in Alpha, or it should be, if you're reading this after I released the mod I might've forgotten to change this readme file)
